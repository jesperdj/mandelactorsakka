MandelActorsAkka
================

Mandelbrot generator implemented with Akka actors.

This is a version of my MandelActors project, but implemented using Akka actors instead of the Scala actors.

This project uses [`sbt`](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). You should be able to compile and run it by installing `sbt` and running the command `sbt run`.

At the moment, configuration is done directly in the source code, in `Main.scala`.
